## **Usage**

### Basic Usage

In order to use the PipeRider Compare Action, you must have a PipeRider project, and create a workflow file in your GitHub repository that specifies this action as one of the steps. It is important to note that this action is only triggered by the pull_request event.

When defining your workflow, you may need to add permissions to the `pull-requests` field in order to enable the action to write to pull requests. You can do this by adding the permissions field as shown below:

To use the PipeRider Compare Action, you can follow the example below:

```yaml
name: PR with PipeRider

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  piperider-compare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: PipeRider Compare
      uses: InfuseAI/piperider-compare-action@v1
```

### DBT Integration
If you are using dbt to manage your data transformation and want to leverage PipeRider to automate data reliability testing, you need to configure your dbt project and GitHub repository settings properly.  We show you how to do this with snowflake as an example.

First, to install a specific adapter, you need a requirements.txt file that lists the dependencies for your project.

```text
piperider[snowflake]
dbt-snowflake
```

Second, you need to put your dbt profiles.yml file under your dbt project root directory in your GitHub repository. This file contains the connection information for your data warehouse and the target schema for your dbt models. PipeRider will use this file to connect to your data source and profile your models.

```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: "{{ env_var('SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT') | as_text }}"

      # User/password auth
      user: "{{ env_var('SNOWFLAKE_USER') | as_text }}"
      password: "{{ env_var('SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD') | as_text }}"

      role: "{{ env_var('SNOWFLAKE_ROLE') | as_text }}"
      database: "{{ env_var('SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE') | as_text }}"
      warehouse: "{{ env_var('SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE') | as_text }}"
      schema: "{{ env_var('SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA') | as_text }}"
      threads: 4
```

Third, you need to set the environment variables for your dbt profiles in the setting page of your GitHub repository. Go to Settings -> Secrets and variables -> New repository secret and add the above secrets:

![secrets and variable setting](docs/assets/actions_secrets_variables_setting.png)

Finally, you need to declare the environment variables in your GitHub workflow yaml file. This file defines the steps for running PipeRider on every pull request. You can use the following template as a reference:

```yaml
name: PR with PipeRider

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  piperider-compare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: PipeRider Compare
      uses: InfuseAI/piperider-compare-action@v1
      env:
        SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT }}
        SNOWFLAKE_USER: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_USER }}
        SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD }}
        SNOWFLAKE_ROLE: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_ROLE }}
        SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE }}
        SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE }}
        SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA }}
```

### (Optional) PipeRider Cloud Usage

<details><summary>Host results on PipeRider Cloud by:</summary>
  
PipeRider Cloud provides an interface for navigating, generating additional comparisons, and sharing results with team members. To use PipeRider Cloud:

1. [Sign up for PipeRider Cloud](https://cloud.piperider.io/signup) to obtain your `cloud_api_token`. Your default cloud project will come with a `cloud_project` id.
2. Add `cloud_api_token` and `cloud_project` parameters to your Action like so:

```yaml
name: PR with PipeRider

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  piperider-compare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: PipeRider Compare
      uses: InfuseAI/piperider-compare-action@v1
      with:
        cloud_api_token: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
        cloud_project: ${{ secrets.PROJECT }}
        upload: true
        share: true
```

The **`upload`** parameter, the action will upload the comparison result to the cloud. The **`share`** parameter is used to generate a shareable link for the comparison result.
