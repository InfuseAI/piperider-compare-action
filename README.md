# **PipeRider Compare Action üöÄ**

The PipeRider Compare Action is a GitHub Action developed by InfuseAI that allows you to run the PipeRider Compare tool directly from your GitHub repository.

## **Description üîç**

This action runs the PipeRider Compare tool and enables you to compare different versions of your DATA üìä. You can use this action to test the quality of your DATA and identify any kinds of issues. So whether you're a developer üßë‚Äçüíª or a data scientist üßë‚Äçüî¨, the PipeRider Compare Action can help you ensure that your data is top-notch!

## **Usage**

In order to use the PipeRider Compare Action, you must have a PipeRider project, and create a workflow file in your GitHub repository that specifies this action as one of the steps. It is important to note that this action is only triggered by the pull_request event.

When defining your workflow, you may need to add permissions to the `pull-requests` field in order to enable the action to write to pull requests. You can do this by adding the permissions field as shown below:

To use the PipeRider Compare Action, you can follow the example below:

```yaml
name: PR with PipeRider

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  piperider-compare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: PipeRider Compare
      uses: InfuseAI/piperider-compare-action@v1
```

It is also possible to use the PipeRider Compare Action with PipeRider Cloud by providing the `cloud_api_token` and `cloud_project` parameters:


```yaml
name: PR with PipeRider

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  piperider-compare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: PipeRider Compare
      uses: InfuseAI/piperider-compare-action@v1
      with:
        cloud_api_token: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
        cloud_project: ${{ secrets.PROJECT }}
        upload: true
        share: true
```

Please note that before using the PipeRider Compare Action with PipeRider Cloud, you need to obtain an **`api_token`** and set up the cloud parameters. With the **`upload`** parameter, the action will upload the comparison result to the cloud. The **`share`** parameter is used to generate a shareable link for the comparison result.

We hope these guidelines will help you use the PipeRider Compare Action effectively in your projects.
